      SQL-07: Use SELECT FOR UPDATE when retrieving rows for later update

      Use the SELECT FOR UPDATE statement to request that locks be placed on all rows
      identified by the query. You should do this whenever you expect to change some or
      all of those rows, and you donâ€™t want another session to change them out from under
      you. Any other session trying to update the rows, or lock the rows
      (perhaps using FOR UPDATE), will have to wait.
